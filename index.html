	<h1>Thomas Zuber</h1>
	<p>My research focuses on the social history of nutrition and childhood in 20th century Burkina Faso. Relying on the insights from history of quantification and development, I argue that children were a critical constituency in the debates about anticolonialism and sovereignty in the past century. </p>
